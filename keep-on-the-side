Schematic of the Brake System Plausibility Device (BSPD): Small device installed in the car that activates the safety relays when there is an implausibility of more than 0.5s.

                <p class="card-text">2. Custom mecanum wheels: For the drivetrain, we used mecanum wheels allowing strafing and smooth movement to be able to quickly change orientation to collect a ball from the ground. Being tight on budget, we decided to 3D print and assemble our own custom mecanum wheels which took around 24h/wheel.</p>
                <p class="card-text">3. Inside view of the 2017 FTC Robot: The upper chain was used for the collecting mechanism that consisted of fast rotating blades that push the balls into an inclined wall that forces them up and into the launch mechanism. The wheels are driven by the lower sprockets connected to the centralised motors.</p>
